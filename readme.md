# Beito Stock Xchange

This is a fun stock market intended for game purposes. It's supposed to be used along with friends during activities such as pre-games where you have both games and drinks. Advancing, and winning, in games gives you the right to buy stocks. The same goes for finishing a drink.

The criteria of winning the stock market can be discussed among the participating players, but total value of the stocks is one option.
